Use of two hands: **hand1** and **hand2**

By command **write** the hand can be set to the wanted angle (in degrees, 0-180). Command will move the hand to the specified orientation.

Eg. move the hand to 90 degrees orientation:


```
hand1.write(90);
```

---

Command **delay** is for pause the program for the desired time (milliseconds) before the next command.

Eg. wait two seconds:

```
delay(2000);
```
